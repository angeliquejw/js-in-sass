# JS in Sass

???
- Play on CSS in JS
- Opportunity to share some of the functionality of JS that you may not know exists in Sass

---

# What are we doing here

- Background
- Sass's surprising capabilities
- Demo to bring it all together

???
- Why was Sass exciting in the first place?
- Walk through capabilities
- Demo

# What was so great about Sass?

--
count: false

- vendor prefixes

???
Through libs like Bourbon and Compass, vendor prefixing became less manual process

Handled more automatically and consistently via PostCSS and Autoprefixer

# What was so great about Sass?

- ~~vendor prefixes~~
- variables

???
- Ability to simplify and make reusable things like color names and font stacks
- For me, this was the initial appeal that got me into Sass

# What was so great about Sass?

- ~~vendor prefixes~~
- ~~variables~~
- nesting

???
While a somewhat controversial benefit, Sass allows nesting of selectors

Not valid CSS, but with PostCSS you can start using the format in the working draft

While not available natively in CSS, we've gotten there in a roundabout way with web components and the various ways styles can be incorporated with React or Vue components

If these were your core reasons for using Sass, you might be questioning what place it has in your front-end stack in 2021 or the next year.

# Mixins: Very basic

Sass code:
```scss
.element {
  @include notice();
}
```

???
- Very basic mixins had a whiff of components to them
- DRY, allow simple, reusable code

--
count: false

Compiles to:
```css
.element {
  background-color: springgreen;
  border: 1px solid;
  border-radius: 0.1em;
  padding: 0.5em;
  text-align: center;
}
```

???
- Single line of `include` allows a developer to recreate a plethora of styles

# Mixins: Very basic

```scss
@mixin notice() {
  background-color: springgreen;
  border: 1px solid;
  border-radius: 0.1em;
  padding: 0.5em;
  text-align: center;
}
```

???
- Actual mixin code is very nearly just CSS
- We can take this further, tho

---

# Mixins: Parameters

```scss
.element {
* @include notice(tomato);
}
```

???
- Note that, in this case, it receives in an argument

--
count: false

```scss
*@mixin notice($color) {
* background-color: $color;
  border: 1px solid;
  border-radius: 0.1em;
  padding: 0.5em;
  text-align: center;
}
```

---
count: false

# Mixins: Parameters

```scss
.element {
  @include notice(tomato);
}
```

```scss
@mixin notice($color) {
  background-color: $color;
  border: 1px solid;
  border-radius: 0.1em;
  padding: 0.5em;
  text-align: center;
}
```

???
- Pause for questions here before diving deeper
- If this was all we could do with Sass, I might not be impressed; there are some ways we can get here with standard CSS
- But, I said earlier that there were whole libraries of Sass functionality -- not just styles, like Bootstrap, but functions -- like adding in those browser prefixes
- Started to dig into those libraries and learn from the code published within

# Basic prefix mixin

Sass code:
```scss
.element {
  @include prefix((
    border-radius: 30px
  ), moz webkit);
}
```

???
If you, too, ever used a prefix mixin, it may have looked something like this

--
count: false

Compiles to:
```css
.element {
  -moz-border-radius: 30px;
  -webkit-border-radius: 30px;
  border-radius: 30px;
}
```

???
This may have been the beginning and end of your relationship with this code. But if you dug deeper to find the mixin behind it all...

---

# Basic prefix mixin

```scss
@mixin prefix($declarations, $prefixes: ()) {
  @each $property, $value in $declarations {
    @each $prefix in $prefixes {
      #{'-' + $prefix + '-' + $property}: $value;
    }

    // Output standard declaration w/o prefix
    #{$property}: $value;
  }
}
```

???
- You'd uncover something like this
- This has some of the readability of CSS, but familiarity with another language like JavaScript is what really helps understand what's going on here

---
count: false

# Basic prefix mixin

```scss
*@mixin prefix($declarations, $prefixes: ()) {
  @each $property, $value in $declarations {
    @each $prefix in $prefixes {
      #{'-' + $prefix + '-' + $property}: $value;
    }

    // Output standard declaration w/o prefix
    #{$property}: $value;
  }
}
``` 

- mixin: named functions w/ param(s)

count: false

# Basic prefix mixin

```scss
@mixin prefix($declarations, $prefixes: ()) {
* @each $property, $value in $declarations {
*   @each $prefix in $prefixes {
      #{'-' + $prefix + '-' + $property}: $value;
*   }

    // Output standard declaration w/o prefix
    #{$property}: $value;
* }
}
``` 

- loops

```scss
@mixin prefix($declarations, $prefixes: ()) {
  @each $property, $value in $declarations {

    }

    // Output standard declaration w/o prefix
*   #{$property}: $value;
  }
}
```

- interpolation: template literals

???
And we can take this even further yet

---

# Prefix mixin: Going further

- default arguments
```scss
prefix($declarations, $prefixes: 'moz', 'webkit')
```

--
count: false

- lists/arrays
```scss
/// List of browser vendor prefixes
$all-vendors: (
  'apple', 'khtml',
  'moz', 'ms', 'o',
  'rim', 'xv', 'webkit'
);
$common-vendors: (
  'moz','webkit'
);
```

# I am intrigued

![](img/terrier-glasses.png)

???
- A lot more feels possible at this point
- Sense of flexibility within Sass
- But, also, to really benefit from this, need some tooling

---

# Console

???
- Namely, one of the ways we teach and debug JS is through console output
- What's the Sass equivalent, is there one?

--
count: false

```scss
@debug
```

???
- prints message, string, values

--
count: false

```scss
@warn
@error
```

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

.text-smaller[More info: _https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/debug_]

???
- warn includes stack trace (debug does not); good for: deprecation notices, style guide corrections
- error stops compilation process; good for: checking functions, mixins
- demo with `notice.scss`

---

# Data types + type checking

???
- One of the other things I want in working with a language is a sense of valid and possible data types
- Both CSS and Sass provide this

--
count: false

```scss
type-of('hello world');
```

???
- `type-of` likely looks familiar to those who've used a similar command in JS
- This combined with debug!
- Demo with `types.scss`

--
count: false

.cf[.left-float[
- string
- number
- boolean
- null
]
.left-float[
- list
- color
- map
]]

# Use case: design tokens

???
So, let's put this all together and explore how Sass' maps and mixins can be used and how debug can help us write that code.

--
count: false

- Parse JSON tokens into usable Sass

???
This is a legit use case, as some systems, like Invision, make information from the design system accessible via JSON and other formats.

--
count: false

- Loop over tokens to create color swatches

# To sum up

## âœ¨ Sass âœ¨

- has usefulness beyond variables and nesting
- can still be useful in your 2021 front-end toolkit
